[Python Library](https://github.com/rnsdomains/rns-python-lib) to resolve your RIF Name Service address on your app.

## Requirements

- Python Version: 3.7
- Pip Version: lastest
- VirtualEnv Version: lastest

## Testing

To run unit tests, clone this repository.

Run Rsk Node and deploy resolver contracts.
Check constants folder to specify, RPC_CLIENT_URL in client_constants.py file and RNS_RESOLVER_ADDRESS in
rns_constants.py file.

Add the PYTHONPATH environment variable of your operating system to the path of the folder where you cloned the project, this will allow the tests to directly invoke the file by console.

Run:

```
pip install virtualenv
```

```
virtualenv -p /yourLocalPythonPath/python3.7 rns_sdk_py_env
```

```
source rns_sdk_py_env/bin/activate
```

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```
python setup.py develop

```

```
python3.7 tests/units/test_resolver_contract.py -v
```

The result that you should see if everything went well is


```

test_addr (__main__.TestResolverConctract) ... ok
test_addr_not_set (__main__.TestResolverConctract) ... ok
test_has_other_kind (__main__.TestResolverConctract) ... ok
test_set_addr (__main__.TestResolverConctract) ... ok
test_set_content (__main__.TestResolverConctract) ... ok
test_supports_interface (__main__.TestResolverConctract) ... ok
test_unsupports_interface (__main__.TestResolverConctract) ... ok
